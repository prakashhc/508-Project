      <h1>While You're At It!</h1>
    </div>


    <h2 id = 'IndexHeader'>Overview</h2>
    <p id= 'IndexText'>Imagine your days as a student: constant lectures, homework assignments, projects, and exams.
        Now, when you are at your dorm or apartment, you’ll be in the zone until you hear your stomach
        grumble. Then, you know that you’ll have to spend at least an hour walking across campus,
        ordering a meal, waiting for it to be prepared, and then finally spending time to eat it. With
        “While You’re At It”, the time spent walking to your favorite restaurants and waiting for your
        meal to get prepared is cut, leaving students to spend more time studying and less time running
        around campus.</p>

    <h2 id = 'IndexHeader'>How It Works</h2>
    <p id= 'IndexText'>How does it work? A user creates a post that is only visible to the people of their building. The
        post includes the fast food location they are going to or the name of the home-cooked meal they
        are preparing in their apartment. Within seconds, people on the app receive a notification and are
        prompted if they want anything from that particular restaurant or if they would like the
        home-cooked dish to be prepared for them.</p>

    <h2 id = 'IndexHeader'>Key Features</h2>
    <ul id= 'IndexText'>
        <h4>User Information</h4>
        <li id='IndexListItem'>Most apps enforce account creation, including ours. Account creation is a major aspect of our
            service since we need to collect information about your location and how to contact you. Upon
            installing our app, we ask for all users to create an account with us, in which users use a unique
            email, have a password, and enter their residence information. By using the residence
            information, we can verify if a user lives in a large apartment or a dormitory, store their address
            for future orders, and strictly enforce that users in the same residential building only place orders
            with others from the same building.</li>
        <h4>Dynamic Roles</h4>
        <li id='IndexListItem'>Dynamic roles refer to how a user can be both a customer and a worker, allowing for easy
            accessibility. The role of the user is easily implemented on the landing page, where there will be
            three navigation sections: courier (delivery or preparing a home-cooked meal), customer
            (includes the order forum as specified below), and settings (allows for users to edit their user
            information).</li>
        <h4>Order Forum</h4>
        <li id='IndexListItem'>In today’s generation, people love simple, straightforward designs. Our application will have a
            clean-cut design and an easy-to-use forum tab in which users can create posts for their building.
            These posts indicate whether a user is going to pick up a takeout order or is preparing a
            home-cooked meal. These posts would have an associated date and time of when the meal would
            be prepared/collected, and would only stay active for a certain amount of time: i.e. up to 1 hour
            for takeout orders, and up to 48 hours for home-cooked meals.</li>
        <h4>Food Safety</h4>
        <li id='IndexListItem'>“While You’re At It” heavily prioritizes food safety, so we included an allergies section. This
            feature forces all users to add a list of their allergies (or N/A if there are no allergies) and
            requires that all home-cooked meals have a list of all allergens that are in their meals. By having
            information about both parties’ allergies, the app will provide warnings to users when they click
            on a home-cooked post.</li>
    </ul>
